## HY-HASES

**HYbrid Hardware ASsited Efficient Signatures (HY-HASES)** is a hybrid PQ-conventional signature. **HY-HASES** combines **LA-HASES** and **PQ-HASES** via a novel nesting approach. This achieves partial aggregation, reinforced by a PQ-FS umbrella signature.

## Quick start

This folder is in progress. Please pardon our dust!
HY-HASES consists of merging [`PQ-HASES`](pqhases/) and [`LA-HASES`](lahases/) digital signatures.
