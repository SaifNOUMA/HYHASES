## PQ-HASES

**Post-Quantum Hardware ASsited Efficient Signatures (PQ-HASES)** is a forward-secure PQ signature. PQ-HASES transforms the one-time hash-based HORS [1] into multiple-time without consorting with heavy sub-tree construction or secure enclaves on signers. 


## Quick start
### Building the software and executing the tests on Linux

One can quickly test PQ-HASES by following the instructions below:

```sh
$ make clean ; make
```


```sh
$ ./App [MSG_LENGTH]
```
